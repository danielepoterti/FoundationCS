She is good with other dogs small and large and is ok with small children however can knock them over easily due to her size so I would say she would be better in a family with older kids. Our two year old can crawl all over her and pull at her hair and she doesn't mind but if she gets in a playful mood she knocks him down which can be scary for some kids.\\n\\nShe needs lots of exercise and attention which she is lacking in our home and with the addition of a new baby it has gotten worse for her. She often has to be locked in a separate part of the house so she doesnt hurt our guests with her jumping and nipping at them and we feel she would be able to enjoy her later years in life in a different home. We are constantly having to tell her to go lay down somewhere because she is just too much around the babies not for being bad just the way she tries to get attention (she leans and pushes on you) ends up knocking them over and hurting them. We have been trying to find her somewhere to go for over a year now with no luck we even posted her on the no kill network back on November 2018 and paid to feature her and no one has been interested.\",\n",

If you have cats, rabbits or other small, furry pets, beware. The TW may view them as prey. Supervise his interactions with them in the home, donâ\\x80\\x99t leave them alone together, and donâ\\x80\\x99t let them out in the yard together.\\n\\nBear in mind that the Treeing Walker is more gung-ho than some other Coonhound breeds.

Heâ\\x80\\x99ll also appreciate the opportunity to run off leash in a safely enclosed area once or twice a week.\\n\\nAs far as training, hounds tend to be independent thinkers who like to do things their own way. They have a short attention span because their interest is always being captured by a scent theyâ\\x80\\x99d like to check out. Assume that if your Walkerâ\\x80\\x99s nose is down, his ears are closed. He is more sensitive, tractable and amenable to training than many hounds, however.

       " 'Recently joining the ranks of the rescue family is Esme, a 8 year-old Mexican hairless girl weighing 6 pounds.\\n\\nArriving at the shelter with 3 teeth, she left the shelter with only 1 because there was a piece of stinky fabric stuck in her teeth and when it was removed, 2 of her teeth came out with the fabric. So...Ms. Esme joins the old lady, \\\\\"tongue brigade,\\\\\" and is getting lots of cuddles and kisses.\\n\\nIf you would like to sponsor Esme\\'s care or apply to adopt her, please visit our website at www.onmywayhomerescue.com or you can donate through our PayPal savethedoxies@gmail.com.\\n\\nThank you for always supporting our rescue mission throughout Southern Nevada.\\n\\nPERSONALITY AND TEMPERAMENT\\nPrized as both a companion and guard dog, the Xoloitzcuintli maintains a calm demeanor even as it remains attentive to its surroundings.  It is an intelligent breed, and generally takes to training easily, as long as the training is gentle and consistent. The Xolo will not respond well to harsh training methods.\\n\\nWhile the adult Xolo is known for being composed and relaxed, the Xolo puppy, like many young animals, is more high energy and will require more daily exercise and attention â\\x80\\x93 and lots of chew toys. If this is given appropriately and as needed and training is consistent and enforced with affection, the Xolo puppy will grow into an admirable and reliable representative for its breed.\\n\\nThe Xolo does retain some of its more primitive characteristics, chiefly as a hunter of small game, so its environment should be one in which it will not be able to easily escape (e.g., high fences, closed gates).\\n\\nHumans have long believed that the Xoloâ\\x80\\x99s warm, soft skin radiates healing energy, so as part of its natural evolution has been in alignment with its human companions, the Xolo has developed  a strong sense of tranquility and patience with humans.  The Xolo is believed to relieve the pains associated with rheumatism and head pains, as well as to help relieve insomnia.\\n\\nCARE\\nThe Xoloitzcuintli needs very little grooming. Generally, a soft, warm cloth to cleanse the skin is sufficient.  Exercise needs are moderate. Daily walks or jogs and outdoor play during warm weather will benefit the Xoloâ\\x80\\x99s health.  Skin care should be undertaken carefully, with regular checks to make sure the skin has not become too dry. Skin care products, lotions, shampoos or anything that has the potential to irritate the skin should be avoided.\\n\\nWith these precautions in mind, keeping your Xolo safe from harsh sunlight, as well as protecting it from cold temperatures will be main concerns. Because they are sensitive to climate, Xolos are considered indoor dogs. They should never be left outdoors for long periods of time. During cold seasons, your Xolo may be more comfortable wearing a sweater, and of course, spending as little time outdoors in the cold as possible.\\n\\nHEALTH\\nAs a result of its natural evolution, the Xoloitzcuintli is a vigorous and healthy breed, with very few health concerns. As previously mentioned, the skin should be protected from chemicals, sun, and temperate changes. When products are needed, stick to skin care products that are specifically formulated for sensitive skin (like baby sun block, baby lotion, etc.). It is always a good idea to check with your veterinarian before using anything new on your Xoloâ\\x80\\x99s skin.',\n",

       " 'Poor Jade has been with the rescue for two years. Jade is a 13 year old Miniature Pincher who was rescued from the local shelter after she was dumped by her previous owners who were having a baby.  Her favorite things to do are cuddle next to her foster parents, hide and sleep under blankets, and go for car rides. \\n\\nJade may be a senior but she has a ton of life left in her and is looking for a home to call her own. She is still spry enough to go to the dog park and go for walks. She recently had her teeth cleaned and her bloodwork shows she needs a kidney friendly diet, which we can supply. She will eventually also need to take kidney medication, which will be covered by the rescue as well. \\n\\nJade is potty trained, her foster home leaves potty pads out when she\\'s going to be gone for extended hours and she uses them. Jade is good with other dogs and doesn\\'t mind sharing her house with a new brother or sister, but also wouldn\\'t mind being your one and only.\\n\\nThis pet is part of our \\\\\"Pips Pals\\\\\" Program. \\n\\nIn March of 2012 we began taking in medically fragile and animals in need of hospice, with our first resident, Pip! However it wasn\\'t until 2019 did we give the program a name and begin to have a focus on those who are so commonly overlooked\\n\\nUnfortunately, our rescue is adoption-based, and that is how we guarantee that we can continue to save lives. But, we could not let these senior and terminally-ill dogs live out their final days in a cold, lonely shelter. So, we started the Pip\\'s Pals Palliative & Hospice Care. \\n\\nThis program relies on hospice foster homes to open their hearts to dogs who will never leave. They will not be able to find a wonderful adoptive family, they will not watch their foster dog transform into a healthy pet, they will never say, see you later,but rather goodbye. As you can imagine, it takes a very selfless, compassionate, and strong foster to do this. Essentially, they are taking these dogs in as their own, and loving them fiercely until it is their time to pass.\\n\\nSay Yes When Others Cannot\\nHospice fostering isn\\'t  cheap, Second Chance covers all of our Pip\\'s Pals medical bills. So, we look to donations to help support this program. Each animal gets special food, pain medicine if needed, various other medicine for eye issues, ear issues, dental issues, etc. as well as ongoing medical care to make sure they are comfortable.\\n\\nWhen the time comes for them to cross the Rainbow Bridge, we believe in their foster home, surrounded by the people (and animals) they love, is the only way to dignify these sweethearts. \\n\\nBelow you will find a list of our current hospice animals. We will keep the ones who have passed on our page as well. They are important. They are loved. Thank you for helping us save them.\\n\\nQuestions? Please email SecondChanceLV@gmail.com\\n\\nIf you are interested in meeting please submit an application by visiting our website, https://www.secondchancelv.org/\\n\\nTo meet  Jade*Sponsored Adoption & Care please e-mail us at secondchanceLV@gmail.com\\n** or view our website, https://www.secondchancelv.org/ to see when you can meet him/her at one of our adoption events. \\n\\nWe are a non-profit organization ran by 100% unpaid volunteers, the adoption fee for each animal is to help offset the costs of running the rescue (medical care, food, shelter, etc) and to ensure that we can continue helping animals.[',\n",

Both of her people passed away within 6 months of each other\\n\\nI cannot imagine how worried she was for them through their illness and how lost she must have felt when they'd gone away. Luckily Tasha found a wonderful temporary foster home for the last few months. They healed her heart, changed her food so her hot spots\\nwent away, and gave her furry siblings and a comfy place to rest and recover. Well, Tasha is feeling so well now that she is making some preferences known. One very important objection is to small children. It's heartbreaking because the kids have really tried to be her friend, but she is not having it. Tasha gets along with other dogs and is tolerant of cats if they leave her alone. She just doesn't want to snuggle with them. We are looking for a child free home to help Tasha be as comfortable as she deserves. She is a senior but has not presented with any health issues.

While he's on the Dogtown trails, he relaxes as he begins to explore all the different smells, and his caregivers have been trying to encourage him to enjoy these outings. Next, he'll be working on getting more comfortable climbing into vehicles so that, eventually, he can enjoy rides too. Apollo has a good appetite and his favorite 'dessert' is cream cheese. He doesn't mind the snow, and during the winter he would chase after snowballs thrown near him. He's done well with all dogs he's met at the Sanctuary and seems to gain confidence by watching them. He still has a lot of puppy energy and would do best in an active home. Because he's shy and fearful with people, he may try to run away, so Apollo will need an understanding person or family to show him that he is safe. Once he gains confidence, he'll make a playful and fun companion. Apollo has a generous sponsor who will cover his adoption fee.\",\n",

He is shy and fearful with strangers, but once he knows you, he will always greet you with a smile and gaze at you in a loving way. He can be a little quirky, and his caregivers say he is like a wiggly cat in a dog's body, but that's what makes him so endearing. Born in 2013, Sundance came to the Sanctuary from a Best Friends Network Partner in Indiana. He guards food and is not comfortable with strangers entering his room or yard. He does better meeting them outside of his area first. At Dogtown, Sundance is doing great with going to his 'place' to wait for his food and with trading his bowls to reduce food guarding. He does not enjoy a lot of handling, especially by new people. He will accept occasional pets but prefers to just do a happy dance around you. He is also difficult for medical handling. He has become comfortable enough with day-to-day handling that he can be harnessed for walks, and he is working on muzzle training for upcoming vet appointments.

Because of his past, Jacko can be nervous meeting new people, especially if he is meeting them for the first time in a small space.

Coop was not well-socialized and came to the Sanctuary from a local animal control department. He is still young, unsure about the world and very sensitive, so he does best in a consistent environment. Coop needs a patient person who will set him up for success by taking time to introduce him to new things and new people.

He does well with people as long as they aren't too touchy right off the bat and are willing to take the time to earn his trust. Once he's comfortable with you, Dukey is very sweet and likes belly rubs and leaning into legs. He does well with other dogs at the Sanctuary, though he prefers dogs who don't have a rough-and-tumble play style.Born in 2009, Dukey is an overall mellow boy, though he does love going for walks. He's earned a reputation as a professional escape artist, with the ability to jump five-foot fences and to open latches. For that reason, he will need a secure environment. Dukey will also guard food and toys. He has some handling sensitivities around his neck and collar, and he gets very nervous and stressed during medical exams. At Dogtown, Dukey has been working on trading food and other items to help with his guarding behavior. His caregivers are also helping him get more comfortable with handling, medical exams and muzzle training. He's looking for an understanding person or family who will help him feel safe.\",\n",
       " 'At the sanctuary, you\\'ll likely find Corban \\\\\"the self-entertainer either throwing a ball to himself and chasing it, being a perfect gentleman on walks with our volunteers, or snuggling up and asking for pets from anyone and everyone he knows. His favorite two activities by far are swimming in the pool at the dog park and hanging his head out of the window on car rides. When Corban first arrived at the sanctuary, he was extremely fearful when meeting strangers, but with the help of his caregivers and some yummy treats, he\\'s come a long way since then and has become a volunteer favorite! Corban has become our go-to tour dog, who has done great meeting groups in Dogtown and getting treats and pets from them. He has lived with dogs in the past, and enjoys the occasional play date. Recently after his friends have been adopted, Corban has been a little picky about his dog friends he lives with. Corban has an autoimmune disorder called Lupus, which is currently well controlled with a daily dose of antibiotics, and doesn\\'t have any impact on his day to day life. If you\\'re looking for a sweet hiking buddy who can take over a game of fetch when you need to go make dinner and then snuggle up on the couch and watch Netflix with you at the end of a long day, Corban\\'s your guy.',\n",

Here at the Sanctuary, she is gaining confidence daily and is making great progress in learning to trust people. She enjoys going on walks, especially if her doggie roommate comes along. She has learned that making eye contact with Dogtown volunteers means that she gets treats, so during most of her walks she will look up at you eager for treats. Clara still doesn't enjoy too much petting, but she will touch her nose to people's hands. At Dogtown, she has learned that having more dog friends is a good thing, and she does great with introductions to other dogs. She enjoys their company and really comes out of her shell with a confident canine friend around. She would do best in a home with another dog who can be a role model for her, but she cannot live with cats.

Ghostrider would do best in a home where he'll get lots of love and attention, because he tends to get a little anxious when left alone.

Since arriving at Dogtown, he has been practicing a training technique during walks that keeps his attention on his caregivers and on treats, making him a very nice walker. Little Bill is not reactive to other dogs, but he does need to be the only pet in a home. He has a prey drive, so smaller animals and cats are just too exciting for him to live with. In the past, Little Bill had some anxiety, but he has adjusted wonderfully to life at the Sanctuary.

She responds well to positive reinforcement and is quite smart. Although she can be slightly nervous when new people enter her space, she does greet people well. Trinity was born in 2014.

Over time, Skelly has made a lot of progress at the Sanctuary. She trusts her caregivers enough to let them leash her up and take her for walks on the trails, which she enjoys. She is starting to explore new places such as Dogtown's indoor agility area and the offices in Dogtown headquarters, where she can experience a more home-like environment. A good way to build trust with Skelly is through hand-feeding her meals. She is still too nervous to get into a car, but she is working on it. She will sometimes eat her meals near a car, which helps her to see that it's not so scary. She also is working on crate training. Because she is still very nervous during medical handling and grooming, Skelly is trained to wear a muzzle during these appointments. She does allow her trusted people to handle her and examine her as needed. Skelly has play dates with other dogs at the Sanctuary, and she has been easygoing with all the dogs she's met. She's also been a good walking buddy for other dogs. She does tend to be a little sensitive and will squeal sometimes if a dog is too rough, so she should live with dogs who understand that and won't scare her. Although she can be hand-fed by those she trusts, Skelly does guard food bowls from people. She has learned to trade them for other items she wants, like treats. She can also be territorial if she doesn't know a person and will protect her space, including her beds and toys.

Stitch absolutely loves to be around people. He is cuddly, sweet and would make a great couch potato. He can wedge his compact, 60-pound body into his caregivers' laps and snuggle for as long as time allows. He does get overexcited when he's being leashed up, so he is working on being calm and not getting mouthy. He does best in calm, quiet environments and when the person leashing him is calm and follows a routine. Stitch does have a previous bite history. He's also very heat sensitive because of his heart condition and his short muzzle, so it's important that he goes for walks when it's not too hot outside. When it comes to other dogs, Stitch can be defensive when he first meets them, but he usually warms up. He'd do best in a home without cats. Stitch does well riding in a car, although he needs a boost to get in. On hotter days, instead of walks, he likes to ride on the golf cart around Dogtown, feeling the breeze in his face. Stitch is crate trained and eats his meals in a crate. Despite his medical challenges, he is friendly and easygoing with the Best Friends veterinary staff and has been great for medical handling here.

But the right combination of medical treatment and TLC has put a smile on Orville's face, a skip in his step and a wag in his tail. Now that all his medical conditions are managed, and he's lost weight and feeling is better, he allows people he knows and trusts to pet him a little. He's even discovered that he likes being patted gently on the head. While Orville guards food and space from other dogs, he is non-reactive and can calmly walk past other dogs. He's also met a few dogs on leash while out for walks and did well when the other dog was calm and non-reactive. Orville takes medication for pain and a thyroid issue. He loves slow strolls, car rides, snacks and splashing around in water. Orville would be a wonderful friend to an understanding person with a gentle touch.\",\n",

Because he's still a bit insecure and anxious, he'll need to find a home with someone who can continue to help him build his confidence, keep up his training and guide him through successful introductions with both people and other dogs. But Fred promises he's worth it. Fred has a generous sponsor who has offered to pay for his adoption fee.\",\n",

       " 'Elwood is a bright-eyed Lab/hound mix who is full of energy and just raring to conquer the world. Born in 2012, Elwood came to Best Friends from a humane society in Wisconsin. As you might imagine, the hound in Elwood has blessed him with an awesome nose and he loves to play \\\\\"find it,\\\\\" while the Labrador in Elwood has provided him with a brain that\\'s eager to learn. In fact, training is one of Elwood\\'s favorite activities. He\\'s already learned commands for sit, down, shake, place, wait and hand targeting! He\\'s an amazing dog. Since Elwood was a pup, he has suffered from noise and storm phobias. This has decreased over time, but has not been eliminated. He also has PTSD from an unfortunate accident that happened at the humane society he was at previously. But when Elwood sees a familiar face, his tail begins to wag uncontrollably and his whole body fills with excitement. He just has to let people know he\\'s happy! He also loves playing with other dogs has lived with a variety of sizes and breeds. Elwood\\'s forever home will need a secure back yard, as his phobias have driven him to jump short fences and open latches in the past. He would do best with a dog savvy, patient person. If you can offer this guy the love and guidance he needs, he\\'ll quickly become your biggest admirer. Will you give Elwood the forever home he\\'s always wanted? Elwood has a generous sponsor who has offered to cover a portion of his adoption costs.',\n",
